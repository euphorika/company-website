## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd website/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

1.  **Testing**

    Test the site components with `yarn test`.

1.  **Formatting**

    Format the source code with `yarn format`.

1.  **Building**

    Build the site with `gatsby build`. Use `gatsby serve` to preview the production build.

1.  **Deploying**

    We deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Please use `yarn deploy` to test the deployment process locally.
